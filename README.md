Assignment to simulate toy crystal lattices in 2D.

A lattice is made of atoms linked with springs which can break. They exist in a world with basic 2D physics, including collision with other atoms, and gravity.

Some images showing collision propagation through the lattice are included, as well as a pdf talk describing the our process.
